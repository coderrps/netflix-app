# Netflix Movie Recommendation System Project Report:[..(https://netflix-recommendation-system-ritu.streamlit.app/)]

## Project Overview

The Netflix Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based application that provides movie recommendations to users based on various features, including director, cast, listed genres, and movie descriptions. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to make these recommendations, and it is designed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Features

The key features of the Netflix Movie Recommendation System include:

1. **Movie Recommendation**: Users can enter the name of a movie, and the system will provide a list of recommended movies that are similar to the input movie.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The application preprocesses the Netflix dataset to create a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix, which is used for computing similarity scores between movies.

3. **Cosine Similarity**: The recommendation engine uses cosine similarity to identify movies that are closely related in terms of features.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preparation**: The Netflix dataset is loaded and processed to handle missing values.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Text-based columns, including director, cast, listed genres, and movie descriptions, are combined to create feature vectors for similarity calculation.

3. **Cosine Similarity**: The TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations are used to identify similar movies.

4. **Streamlit Web Application**: The user interface is built using Streamlit, which allows users to interact with the recommendation system.

## Data Source

The Netflix dataset used in this project is sourced from the following GitHub repository. Kaggle

## Installation and Usage

To run the Netflix Movie Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application by executing the following command in the project directory:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the application in a web browser using the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Future Improvements

- The system can be enhanced with user-specific recommendations by incorporating user profiles and ratings data.
- Integration with a larger and more diverse dataset to improve recommendation quality.

## Conclusion

The Netflix Movie Recommendation System is a powerful tool for suggesting movies to users based on textual features. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide relevant recommendations, enhancing the user's streaming experience.
